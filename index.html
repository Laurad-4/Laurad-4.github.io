      <h3>Political Campaigns & Advocacy</h3>
      <p>The digital era has changed the way campaigns get their message out to voters. Political digital marketing allows the candidate to reach thousands of voters. Campaigning is also more challenging even post pandemic since door-to-door canvassing is less accepted with voters. Reach your voters with digital strategies such as Geo and IP targeting.</p>
      <p>Peer to Peer texting has gained popularity in recent years. P2P texting is one of the most effective ways to reach voters with personalized messages to GOTV, reminders about events, and encouragement about the candidate.</p>
      <p>Email marketing is also a popular tool candidates use to communicate with their base. Email marketing encourages engagement with voters so they can learn more about the candidate, sign up for events, for political polling purposes, yard sign placement, etc.</p>
